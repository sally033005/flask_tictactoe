## 🎮 Tic Tac Toe – Flask Web Game

A full-stack Tic Tac Toe web application built with **Flask**, supporting both **single-player (AI)** and **two-player multiplayer** modes. Players can compete against an AI with multiple difficulty levels or play with another user in a shared game room using a unique join code.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧍 Single Player Mode

* Play against an AI opponent
* Three difficulty levels:

  * **Easy** – Random moves
  * **Medium** – Defensive logic (win/block strategy)
  * **Hard** – Optimal play using the **Minimax algorithm**
* Win tracking across rounds
* Instant game reset

### 👥 Two Player Mode (Multiplayer)

* Create a private game room with a **unique 6-character code**
* Second player joins using the room code
* Turn-based gameplay enforced by the server
* Shared game state synced via polling (`/game_state`)
* Detects:

  * Player disconnection (inactivity timeout)
  * Player leaving the game intentionally
* Win tracking for both players
* Supports replaying without recreating the room

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **AI Logic:** Rule-based strategy & Minimax algorithm
* **State Management:** Flask sessions + in-memory game store
* **Deployment:** Render

## 🧠 Difficulty Modes Explained

* **Easy Mode**
  AI selects a random available cell.

* **Medium Mode**
  AI prioritizes:

  * Winning moves
  * Blocking the player’s winning moves
    Creates a more realistic challenge.

* **Hard Mode**
  AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, guaranteeing optimal play and making it unbeatable.

## 🔄 Multiplayer Game Flow

1. Player 1 creates a room and receives a **join code**
2. Player 2 enters the code to join the room
3. Game state is shared and updated via `/game_state`
4. Server enforces turns and validates moves
5. Disconnections and exits are detected and communicated to the remaining player
